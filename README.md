# longest-repeating-substring

This repository is used to document my efforts to solve a challenge.

# Update 08.07.2020

The challenge is hosted by ZÃ¼hlke Engineering AG and consists of 5 different challenges.
https://challenge.zuehlke.com/

I managed to crack all of them, but really only the first one needed some coding to be done. I won't publish or share the answers, as the challenge is still on-going.
